Really poor service - presence doesn't work properly!!  
Product: Resonate Contact Centre Service

I'm really angry that I installed this service. The presence is supposed to update from Teams but it doesn't work. When I complained to Resonate they said they couldn't fix it because of Microsoft. This VoIP stuff is rubbish - I'd rather go back to the good old days of ISDN. The only positive thing is that the support guys are really friendly and try and help - but the solution just isn't well designed - NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!
