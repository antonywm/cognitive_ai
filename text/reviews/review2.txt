Poor Service keeps failing!
Product: Resonate Contact Centre Service
21/7/2021
The contact centre service which Resonate installed from Luware is rubbish. It doesn't allow me to do hardly any self care and every time I need a change it seems Resonate have to get Luware to do it. It takes ages and its poor and slow. I'm really unhappy with the service.
